Ubuntu 18.04下安装Bunlder和PMVS(CMVS)
参考：Ubuntu 16.04下安装Bunlder和PMVS(CMVS)https://www.jianshu.com/p/ef3ef6fdf354

1.安装bundler
下载bundler-v0.4-source.tar.gz
extract 
cd bundler-v0.4-source
make

出现问题：error trying to exec 'f951': execvp: No such file or directory
参考https://github.com/snavely/bundler_sfm/issues/58
sudo apt install gfortran
没有解决

 安装依赖
为了编译和运行Bundler，我们需要安装如下依赖
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev libblas-dev minpack-dev f2c gfortran jhead imagemagick
接下来继续安装SIFT依赖
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
安装CMVS-PMVS依赖
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libdevil-dev libboost-all-dev libatlas-cpp-0.6-dev libatlas-dev libcminpack-dev libgfortran3 libmetis-edf-dev libparmetis-dev freeglut3-dev libgsl0-dev

You are probably using a makefile which thinks that the default compiler for Fortran should be a GNU compiler.
Run Make from the IFort environment, or try to build a simple Fortran program without using Make from the same environment.

You don't need a gfortran installation to use ifort. If you ask gcc (which you do need) to compile a Fortran source file, it will look for gfortran.
The ifort installation doesn't change anything in the gcc installation. As already mentioned, you would use ifort command (with ifort environment variables set) to start the ifort compiler.
